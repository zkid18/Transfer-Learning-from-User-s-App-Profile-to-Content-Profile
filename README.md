# Transfer-Learning-from-User-s-App-Profile-to-Content-Profile
For a new user in recommendation app, it lacks data on user behavior (User behavior is important for advertising and preference recommendation).
This will cause app recommendation fail because nowadays recommendation system are mostly based on machine learning which requires a big mount of data. So, there is always a cold start problem, because of lacking data in project domain especially in recommendation system. This can be solved by transfer learning when we have data in a similar domain. We aim to solve the problem by transfer learning target domain to a similar domain with high confidence and get the predictive result.
